- <a href="http://pythonforbiologists.com/index.php/introduction-to-python-for-biologists/">Python for Biologists</a> is freely available online and designed for complete beginners. It's a practical introduction to Python because it uses biological examples. <a href="http://pythonforbiologists.com/index.php/books/">Advanced Python for Biologists</a> is a book that dives deeper by discussing techniques for building larger programs, including recursion and trees, complex data structures, object-oriented Python, functional Python, comprehensions, and exceptions.

- <a href="http://biopython.org/wiki/Biopython">Biopython</a> is a set of freely available tools for biological computation written in Python by an international team of developers.

- In class, we will solve some introductory problems using <a href="http://rosalind.info/">ROSALIND</a>, but the resource includes many advanced problems that get more challenging as you move down each <a href="http://rosalind.info/problems/topics/">topic list</a>. Check out those of interest to you and build your skills. You may get an idea for a group project by doing these exercises.

- <a href="https://www.biostars.org/p/123728/">Resources</a> for statistical computing in R.

- A straight-forward <a href="http://www.cureffi.org/2014/08/27/git-tutorial/">GitHub tutorial</a> written by a computational biologist that will get you started. 

- A couple of ~20 minute YouTube videos introducing <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>: one from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE">LearnCode.academy</a> and one from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXoWxrTdXkM">GEEKBLOGTV</a>.
