<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="objectives"></a>Course Objectives: </span>

- Analyze primary literature in the field of bioinformatics and computational biology
- Design and implement advanced data structures for computational biology
- Design and implement advanced algorithms for computational biology
- Increase proficiency in object-oriented and scripting programming languages




<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="texts"></a>Course Materials: </span>

There is no specific text for this course. Rather, we will be using free online materials and the scientific literature. See <a href="http://hwheeler01.github.io/CompBio/resources/">Resources</a>.

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="honesty"></a>Academic Integrity: </span><br>

Plagiarism and cheating will not be tolerated (see <a href="http://www.luc.edu/academics/catalog/undergrad/reg_academicintegrity.shtml">University Policy</a>) and will be
reported to the college. STUDENTS FOUND TO PRESENT SOMEONE ELSE’S WORK AS THEIR OWN WILL **RECEIVE ZERO POINTS FOR THE ASSIGNMENT**. ANY STUDENT WHO REPEATS SUCH AN ACTION WILL RECEIVE A FAILING GRADE (F) FOR THE COURSE.

The ROSALIND and Python programming assignments at the beginning of the semester will be done independently (although you can get help from each other in class). Cheating includes submitting as your own work something that has been written by another person (classmate, tutor, web site, etc.). You must comment your code in your own words to demonstrate that you understand it. You may be asked questions about how your code works and your comments will help you explain.  Inability to answer such questions will result in a reduced grade.

After the first third of the course, the rest of the course will be spent working on a group project. As part of a group, you are expected to contribute to the same degree as your teammates. As such, “coasting” or letting your teammates carry you is in fact plagiarism; you are taking credit for contributions that you did not make. This is on-par with presenting in a paper someone else’s idea/work as your own without proper citation. Plagiarism and cheating of any form will not be tolerated. A student suspected of such behavior will be assessed on an individual basis and action taken per the instructor’s evaluation of the seriousness of the
behavior. Repeat offenders will earn an F for the course.
As a contributing member of a group, it is your responsibility to ensure that all members are contributing. Issues that cannot be resolved within the group should be reported to the instructor. (Anonymous reports are welcome.)

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="disabilities"></a>Students with Special Needs:</span>&nbsp; 

Any student with special needs or difficulties in learning and completing course assignments is strongly encouraged to contact the instructor as soon as possible. Please refer to the Student Handbook for student rights and <a href="http://www.luc.edu/sswd/">available resources</a> pertaining to assistance with special needs or disabilities.
