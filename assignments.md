##ROSALIND
Rosalind, named after superstar scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin">Rosalind Franklin</a>, is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving. We will be using it in COMP 383 to introduce Python and to practice solving computational problems relevant to molecular biology.

The first 4 assignments in the course will be submitted via the Rosalind interface. To enroll, click
<a href="http://rosalind.info/classes/enroll/f74db871de/">here</a>.

Once you are enrolled, you will see the assigment problems listed <a href="http://rosalind.info/classes/254/">here</a>. Each problem is due by 11:59 PM on the date listed (see <a href="http://hwheeler01.github.io/CompBio/syllabus/#schedule">course schedule</a>). You will be required to upload your commented code with your solution to each problem. Your code must be commented in **your own words** and turned in independently. Code should be commented sufficiently so someone learning Python can understand it. **If you had a partner for a problem, note his/her name in your code comments**. Cheating includes submitting as your own work something that has been written by an outside person (or web site). If you are working with a partner, an “outside person” refers to someone other than your partner.

##Group Presentations
You will be involved in four group presentations over the course of the semester. All members of the group must contribute to the development of the presentation as well as participate in the actual presentation. Each presentation will be followed by question & answer period; all members should be able to contribute to addressing the questions. All presentations should be made using either Microsoft PowerPoint or Adobe. Slides should be clear, straight-forward, and concise. Presentation files are due via Sakai prior to the start of class on the day of the presentation.
- **Initial Group Presentations of Projects (10 pts):** This presentation will be 20-30 minutes in length. The group will present to the entire class the problem they will aim to solve. This requires digging through the literature to present the background and motivation as well as the “current state” of things for the problem. This presentation must also discuss the language that will be used for development and an outline of the key milestones/deliverables.- **5-minute Group Progress Presentations (5pts each, 2 presentations total):** As the name implies this will be a quick presentation with two functions: 1) bring the class up to speed on the progress that has been made and 2) introduce any challenges impeding progress. This presentation should include the original milestones/deliverables and discuss how the project is progressing.- **Final Group Presentation (10 pts):** This presentation will be 12-15 minutes in length. This is the standard time allotted to oral presentations at a conference. In the presentation, you will present the background, methods, results, and conclusions/future directions. The key to this presentation is being concise and clear. You should be shooting for 12 minutes on the nose which gives time for a question or two. Questions can actually help your presentation, clarifying things you perhaps did not present clearly... it’s like the second chance. At 15 minutes all presentations/questions will be stopped. (This is what they really do at a conference.) Your grade will reflect the presentation made not the presentation given.

##Blogs
There will be four “due dates” for Blogs, 5 points each. This will serve as your “Research notebook”. Your Blog will be through Sakai. Each student will have their OWN Blog. Each blog itself is worth 2 points. You must also go into your group mate’s blogs and comment on their blog... a few sentences will suffice... although more is never a bad thing. Your blogging is due by 11:59PM on the day of class that it is indicated due. You must go through and comment on your group mate’s blogs (plural) by 11:59PM on the Friday following. A few notes on blogs. You can log multiple times on an entry via edit. Please do this so it is clear which blog corresponds to which week. Please indicate on the first line of your blog a sentence to the effect of “This is my blog #1” or #2, etc.

##Project Code
Commented code is due on the day of the scheduled final exam period by 11:59PM. This code should be hosted online through GitHub. Included with this code is a straight-forward documentation and sample data. The code should have adequate documentation such that anyone could download the code, install it or get it to run, and run through the test data without encountering any problems; this should be thought of as a User’s Manual. If I cannot run the code and run the test data, I cannot grade the functionality of the code. This code will be graded as follows: 2 pts comments; 2 pts documentation; 0.5 pt sample data; 0.5 pt creation of site; 10 pts functionality.

##Application Note
Parallel to the code developed, you will also be drafting what is commonly referred to as an “Applications Note”. This is a brief (2-page journal style, 1000-1300 words plus one image) presentation of the application. It includes and Abstract, Background, Implementation, Results, and References sections. The Abstract should be brief (100-200 words). The Background section should introduce the problem as well as the existing software tools that are available to solve the problem, a subset of the problem, or a closely related problem. The Implementation will include details about the development of the application in ENGLISH. In other words, what functionality was developed (not a list of classes/functions); this includes the run-time and memory usage estimates. The Results section typically includes the actual use of your software on a set of data to show how it solves the problem at hand. Likewise, the same set of data is then used to be analyzed by OTHER available tools in an effort to show how your solution is superior.You will have two grades – and these will be group grades – for the Application Note: a Rough Draft (5 pts) and the Final Draft (10 pts). The Rough Draft, due 2 weeks prior to the final paper will provide you with the opportunity to get feedback on your paper; it’s an all or nothing grade (i.e. you turn something in, you get the points). This should, however, not be looked at as easy points; it is an opportunity to get feedback.
